# Replicating-a-SA-Approach-to-Solving-the-GMS-Problem
The general maintenance scheduling (GMS) problem aims to  nd an optimal planned preventative maintenance schedule for generating units in a power system under certain constraints (for example, power demand and manpower availability). The problem is combinatorial in nature, and is typically too complex for exact solution methods such as non-linear programming. Simulated annealing as a tool frequently used to solve this problem , and there are a number of conventions for doing so [2]. This report aims to reproduce the algorithms employed by Schlunz [2], in particular those that produced the best results in the paper for the 32- and 21-unit test systems run over 52 weeks. The best results were obtained using a particular con guration of settings which we will attempt to replicate in our version. 2
